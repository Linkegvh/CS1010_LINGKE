test.c is about array manipulation that is pretty difficult to trace

test1.c is about file io which is an area that I am pretty weak at

test2.c is about a code that is extreme difficult to know what has gone wrong, but thankfully, guoquan told me that in order to change the pointer value in another function, you cannot just call the pointer name, you must call it *pointer to refer to the original address of the variable that you want to change.

test3.c is about string manipulation that is a bit difficult to see also + random number

test4.c is about structures

test5.c is about recursions
